# Visualizations with PALLADIO  
&nbsp;
> *“Through visualization, we are seeking to portray data in ways that allow us to see it in a new light, to visually observe patterns, exceptions, and the possible stories that sit behind its raw state. This is about considering visualization as a tool for discovery.”*
