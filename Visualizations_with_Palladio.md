# Visualizations with PALLADIO  
&nbsp;
> *“Through visualization, we are seeking to portray data in ways that allow us to see it in a new light, to visually observe patterns, exceptions, and the possible stories that sit behind its raw state. This is about considering visualization as a tool for discovery.”*

Given that especially in recent times (that is, in times of increasing computerization as well as digitalization) great emphasis is put on the wide-ranging values of data visualization, as illustrated by the introductory quote, I thought it worthwhile to include some visualizations I created for an analysis of the text at issue here within the pages of this GitHub project.  
They have been realized with the help of a currently popular software for such purposes, that is called **PALLADIO**. Provided that you have (more or less) well-structured data at hand, this tool allows you – using its producers’ slogan – to *“visualize complex historical data with ease”*, albeit at present (as of fall 2020) only with a set of rather basic functionalities. Originally a product of a large-scale project funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities (“Networks in History: Data-driven tools for analyzing relationships across time”, 2013-2016), PALLADIO has been developed and is up to the present day maintained by an interdisciplinary team based at the Stanford University (cf. the website: https://hdlab.stanford.edu/palladio/). In order to create a graph, a list, a map or a gallery based on your data, you just have to input these data in the form of a csv file or a similarly structured file type and, where appropriate, adjust the proposed settings for the visualization of your choice.  

In a first attempt to test the application, I prepared a csv file containing data about the **participants of the First Crusade** as attested in the first book of the *Gesta Francorum*. For the first graph presented here (**Fig. 01**), the crusaders’ contingents, named after their leaders for sake of simplicity, and their individual members have been selected as *“nodes”*, linked to one another by simple *“edges”*, to use the standard terms of (social) network analysis. The *“nodes”* of the contingents have been highlighted, with their size indicating the weight of a contingent related to the named crusaders as a whole. For the second graph (**Fig. 02**), another combination of *“nodes”* has been chosen: here, the individual crusaders are linked to their (historical) regions of provenance, as given in my csv file. The *“nodes”* of the latter have been highlighted, with their size, again, indicating their quantitative weight.

Both graphs clearly confirm - among other things - a prominent position of the Norman crusaders of Southern Italy and in particular the contingent led by Bohemond of Taranto within the narrative of the *Gesta Francorum* – an observation, I admit, that will hardly surprise the informed reader, since the author of (at least considerable portions of) the text is by most scholars seen as a follower precisely of this Norman prince / commander.  

However, the creation of these graphs should also provide reason to critically reflect on challenges and limits in using a software like PALLADIO. For its visualization tool, to name just the most striking point, requires unambiguous allocations of values and the input of "normalized" data, even if a dataset of interest is rather disparate or inconsistent and cannot easily be re-structured without a resolute act of interpretation, if not downright simplification. In concrete terms, regarding my *Gesta Francorum* data: In order to assign to every crusader a larger area of provenance, I had to draw lines of political geography and determine, e.g., whether the County of Flanders should be interpreted as part of the Kingdom of France or of the Holy Roman Empire – regarding the location of its territories at the time, both options seem perfectly reasonable; comparably, in order to assign to every crusader a single army or contingent leader, I sometimes had to set up ties of allegiance, though they are scarcely testified in the text and there were probably more complex networks of relationships within the single expeditions (– leaving aside here the cases where crusaders changed their allegiance during the course of events).  
So, to be brief and not to overstretch here a discussion of this scope, I would conclude: Data visualization – with PALLADIO or another tool of your choice – can be useful to get to the heart of an issue, to discover or confirm possibly relevant relationships and to rise interesting research questions, but you need a thorough knowledge of your data and ideas how to format and even to manipulate them in acceptable and reasonable ways, to benefit from an endeavor of this kind.  
Let me refer you, at the end of this small exposé, to a comparable statement made by Marten Düring, a historian, who may be termed a leading expert for the visualization of historical networks:

> *Visualisations are of course not “proof” of anything but tools to help understand complex relations; their interpretation is based on a good understanding of the underlying data and how it was visualized.*
