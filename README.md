# gesta-francorum

## About
This repository contains material for a digital edition of the *Gesta Francorum*, an early, anonymously handed down chronicle about (and one of the most commonly quoted sources for the study of) the First Crusade.

## Project
The initiative for the project presented here goes back to an introductory course about digital editorial activities, offered for students of various disciplines at the Free University of Berlin. Based on the experiences and insights gained during this course was born the idea to explore by means of a model case potential opportunities and benefits of a “digital edition” in the proper meaning of the word.  
Therefore, having familiarized himself at least with the essential concepts and technologies, the author of these lines chose a in his eyes editorially challenging text from one of his fields of interest, worked out an editorial design in line with the envisaged purposes of use and started – as a first step in the workflow – with a thorough markup of the text. As is a common practice, he based this preliminary work (regarding primarily the storage of text data) on the **Extensible Markup Language (XML)** in accordance with the current version (P5) of the Guidelines of the **Text Encoding Initiative (TEI)** (s. [https://tei-c.org/guidelines/p5/](https://tei-c.org/guidelines/p5/), which seem to have become sort of a standard in the Digital Humanities. (...)

## File List

* **Gesta_Francorum_1(DE).xml / Gesta_Francorum_1(EN).xml**:  
Latin text of the *Gesta Francorum* according to the reference manuscript (Reg. Lat. 572), marked-up with regard to intended purposes of the edition according to the TEI standards, provided with relevant meta data and editorial notes in a German and an English version.

* **Plain_text.txt**:  
Latin text of the *Gesta Francorum* according to the reference manuscript (Reg. Lat. 572), with all abbreviations resolved, but without any markup / annotation of the document.

* **Index_personarum.xlsx**:  
Numbered list of persons mentioned in the *Gesta Francorum*, displayed in the form of a table that contains – besides the variants attested in the text – standardized English versions of their names and, where available, links to existing authority files\* as well as to the entries in the “Database of Crusaders”: despite its still provisional status an excellent prosopographical resource compiled by a team of leading scholars of the Crusades (s.

* **Font_files** (folder):  
Files for the **Palemonas MUFI font** (version 3.0) selected in this project to typographically display the text of the reference manuscript (Reg. Lat. 572) in a form usable for palaeographical studies. The font, developed by a team around the Lithuanian computer scientist Vladas Tumasonis, has been deployed as a freeware and is still one of the essential fonts recommended by the scholars of the MUFI group. It is freely available via the MUFI website on the Internet: s. [https://folk.uib.no/hnooh/mufi/fonts/index.html#PalemonasMUFI](https://folk.uib.no/hnooh/mufi/fonts/index.html#PalemonasMUFI).

* **Abbrev_pics_Reg-Lat-572** (folder):  
Selected image files of particular abbreviations used in the reference manuscript (Reg. Lat. 572), for whose typographical representation specialized solutions had to be found. (= to be expanded)

* **Bibliography.xml**:  
Preliminary bibliography to the project, including previous editions of the *Gesta Francorum* and a selection of relevant research literature. (= to be expanded)
